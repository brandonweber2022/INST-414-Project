# NBA Salary Predictor
Sprint 3 complete

**Problem to Solve**:
There is currently no public system or model for deciding how much an NBA player should be paid based in performance. 

The goal of this project is to accurately be able to predict salary from statitsica performance. The other goal is to create a tool to give the salary number that player should be given based on performance. 

**Dataset Description**
The dataset that I used for this project is a Kaggle dataset titled "NBA Player Salaries (2022-23 Season)". It includes the statistics of every player from the 2022-23 NBA season, as well as their salary. It has 467 rows, as well as 51 variables. 

**Methods**
I analyzed Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost models to see which performed the best on salary prediction for this data. Sci-kit learn was the primary Python library that I used.
